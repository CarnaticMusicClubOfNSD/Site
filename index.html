  <section class="about">
    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      In 2022, a passionate high school student, <strong class="highlight">Shreya Battula</strong>, envisioned a way to share her love for Carnatic music with the younger generation in her community. What began as a small after-school club at Canyon Creek Elementary with 5 students has grown to inspire <strong>90+ students</strong> through a district-wide initiative. Now spanning <strong>3 Northshore School District elementary schools</strong>—and still expanding—the program is led by <strong>6 instructors</strong> and chapter heads, introducing young learners to the rich tradition of Indian classical music and proving how one student’s passion can create lasting community impact.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      This journey wouldn't have been possible without the unwavering support of our Mentors <strong class="highlight">Mr. Elliot Gray</strong> (Canyon Creek’s Music and Marimba teacher) and <strong class="highlight">Mr. Srinivas Khedam</strong> (NSD's Assistant Director, Family Engagement). From the early days of planning to the club’s flourishing success, their guidance has been instrumental every step of the way.

    <h2>Curriculum & Structure</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Carnatic music</strong>, a classical musical form originating in <strong>South India</strong>, is renowned internationally for its <strong>intricate melodies and rhythms</strong>. Developed over centuries and formalized around the 15th century, it is traditionally taught through a <strong>step-by-step system</strong> that cultivates both musical understanding and discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Carnatic Music Club, students are introduced to this rich tradition starting with <strong>Sarali Swaras</strong>, the fundamental exercises that form the foundation of Carnatic music. The club follows an <strong>11-week program</strong> designed with <strong>performance-based learning objectives</strong>, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic Carnatic music theory</strong> – understanding the structure and nuances of compositions</li>
      <li><strong>Vocal warmups and technique</strong> – building voice control and pitch accuracy</li>
      <li><strong>Core beginner-level sequences</strong> – developing skill and confidence</li>
      <li><strong>Live student performance showcase</strong> – celebrating progress and cultivating stage presence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structured approach not only develops technical proficiency but also fosters <strong>creativity, confidence, and cultural appreciation</strong>, ensuring that each student experiences the <strong>joy of learning and performing a classical art form</strong>.
